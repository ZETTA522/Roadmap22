My favourite YouTube channels to learn web3:

1) Whiteboard Crypto : To understand the basic concepts  <br/> 
2) Altcoin Daily : For daily crypto news <br/>
3) Coin Bureau : For detailed analysis of projects <br/>
4) Finematics : To understand DeFi protocols <br/>
5) Smart Contract Programmer : To learn advanced solidity concepts <br/> 
6) Web3 Club : To learn popular smart contracts and standards <br/>
7) EatTheBlocks & Dapp University : For basics of career in blockchain <br/> 
8) Moralis Web3 : For creating DApps faster <br/>
9) Thinklair : For brilliant, crisp and no-nonsense explanation of blockchain concepts <br/>


<br/>
This is how strong is the web3 dev shortage supply. Looksrare offers 600k$/y compensation packages. it's 3x tech companies.

We will see A LOT more software talents migrating.

Reco for smart engineers leaving schools : start to learn EVM compatible code like Solidity. It will payoff 10x.


<br/>

Step-1: Learn Html
Step-2: Learn CSS
Step-3: Learn JavaScript
Step-4: Learn React
Step-5: Learn Solidity
Step-6: Learn Web3.js or Ethers.js
Step-7: Dive into the rabbit hole
Step-8: Go back to step 3


<br/> <br/> 
Step by step guide to learn Blockchain DApp Development from scratch (use google, youtube, udemy):

# 1) LEARN BASICS OF BLOCKCHAIN
a) How Blockchain works
b) How Cryptocurrency works - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Stable Coins
c) Definition of Smart Contract, EVM, Cryptocurrency vs Tokens, NFTs, Metamask, Gas Fee
d) Definition of Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake  <br/>

# 2) LEARN WEB DEVELOPMENT
a) Frontend - HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS
b) Backend/ Server-side / Package Manager - Node JS, NPM, Express, MongoDB, APIs
c) Command Line Interface and GitHub <br/>

# 3) LEARN SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT <br/>
a) Solidity - For creating Smart Contracts
b) Web3.js or Ethers.js - For connecting Smart Contracts with the Frontend
c) Remix - Smart Contract editor for beginners
d) Truffle or Hardhat - Smart Contract framework for intremediate to advanced developers
e) Chai/ Mocha - For Smart Contract Testing
f) Ganache/ Rinkeby - Testnets for Smart Contracts

Optional - Learn Moralis for faster DApp Development and creating demo projects

P.S. This is the path I followed for learning Solidity/EVM based DApp development. There are alternate paths as well. Plus a few more advanced tools that I'm still learning.

## Want to be hired as a blockchain developer within a year?

If you are getting started, have these projects in your portfolio

At least have these use cases FIRST:

- ERC20 (Vesting and Cliff, Allocations)

- ERC721 and ERC1155 (Lazy Minting, Minter Site)

- Marketplace (Minting, Trade, Fee Structures)

- Stake and Airdrops (Utility and Marketing Strategies)

- Lending (Lending ERC20 and ERC721)


_Use HTML5 to set up a quick interactive portfolio site, host it on GitHub for FREE.


These use cases show versatility and broad knowledge of different ERCs. There are plenty of FREE tutorials and resources to build on top of them.

What other projects would you add?
