1) Take a cheaper/free online course to understand the basics

2) Find a learning buddy to discuss the topics with each other and resolve doubts (You can find one via LinkedIn)

3) Buy a small amount of ether/matic from an exchange

4) Download Metamask and learn how to use it

5) Transfer your ether/matic to Metamask and understand how gas fee works

6) Learn how to move matic to Polygon network using a bridge

7) Using Metamask balance, buy some crypto using a Dex like Uniswap, you can also use a testnet version where you can use fake ether from a 'testnet faucet'

8) Watch videos on how popular DeFi DApps like aave, compound and popular NFT marketplaces like opensea, rarible work

9) If your budget allows (that you were thinking of wasting on that certification anyway) try 'staking' on these DeFi platforms or try buying an NFT after doing proper research. At least you'll learn how these DApps work

10) Once you've learnt the basics, continue learning and teach others

11) And finally keep following the crypto industry news using an online resource of your choice





Blockchain development learning stages

0 coding experience

Cycles repeat until skill is acquired:

Month 1 = Excitement

Month 3 = Most Quit Here
Month 4 = Excitement Again…
Month 5 = Hard But With Progress
Month 6 = Second Quitting Wave
Month 7 = You Get The Point….

If you come from web2
Takes between 6 months to a year to learn

If you come from 0 coding, 1 to 2 years.
It can be less but you have to put in the work.




The winners in web3 will be the ones that clearly:

-Focus on building
-Focus on being boring
-Focus on creating tools
-Focus on solving problems
-Focus on hiring great talent



Successful blockchain developers

Do these 3 things:

- Build (MVPs, features, utilities)

- Live Below Their Means (rent, car)

- Build More!


Here is why:

Uniswap, Solana, OpenSea where built in 2018 during the bear market.

Every wave of new blockchain developers come during a bull market.

By 2024, you should have 2 to 3 years of experience in the space.

The new wave can’t compete against you if you keep going today!

Don’t give up!



9 to 5 is over.

Remote work in blockchain is the norm.

Why?

- Payments can be made in crypto

- English is the only language you need

- Pool of jobs is much bigger globally

- Micromanaging is not possible anymore

- Live cheap anywhere with a high salary
